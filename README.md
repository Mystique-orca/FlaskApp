# FlaskApp - BlogIt
This is a prototype of a webapp for Blogs.

It is entirely based on Python-Flask framework.

Salient features:
1) You can create user and login into your profile. The credentials are stored securely in sqlite database, using SHA-256 encryption
2) You can create new posts, view or update existing posts. This will require your account already created.
3) You can read the posts on the homepage, although likes and comments are coming up as an update shortly
